# The Depths
The sprawling and winding under-city of [[Aeol]], while looked down upon for being full of misfits and outcasts these tunnels provide an essential source of water for the city. This part of the city can't be reached by the [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html) public transport system.
