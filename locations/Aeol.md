# Aeol

Twining almost organic looking towers of Sintered Crystal rise from the dune fields. In the absence of roads linking the towers a profusion of ropes and cables network the towers together carrying gondolas and suspending bridges. The areas between these cables flock with residents gliding with squirrel-suites and kite-gliders, and swirl with Dragons and kites. Markets find their places in open tunnels that pierce the sides of the towers. The constant wind over the cables and tunnel mouths raises a continuous background noise of aeolian harps, flutes, and singing bowls.
