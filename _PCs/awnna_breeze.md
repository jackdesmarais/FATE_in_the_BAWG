## Aspects
1. High Concept: **Naturally gifted mechanic who has an uncanny skill to understand and work with technology of all kinds**
2. Trouble: **Is sometimes overconfident and ends up pushing her limits, physically and/or intellectually, if she begins to fail**
3. Goal: **To make herself wings (not a wing suit) that allow her to fly as fast as Isu**
4. Connections: **Everyone is creative and she feels drawn to it/inspired by them**
5. Wild Card: **Has a pet dragon named Isu that she can communicate with/understand**

## Stunts
1. Mechanic: Gain a +2 bonus using Crafts \[and Lore?], whenever the situation has specifically to do with technology or engineering.
2. Better than New: Whenever you succeed with style on an overcome action to repair a piece of machinery, you can immediately give it a new situation aspect (with a free invoke) reflecting the improvements you’ve made, instead of just a boost.
3. Dragon Flight: You can coax more speed out of your wingsuit than seems possible. Whenever Isu is nearby and you’re engaged in any contest where speed is the primary factor (such as a chase or race of some kind) and you tie with your Flight roll, it’s considered a success.
