# Windy Gate Public Library
Taking up three floors in a spire near the center of windy gate, the public library has huge bay windows, elaborately mosaic'd floors, and double height ceilings. Books are stored as crystal microfiche scrolls moved from a back room to reading kiosks by pneumatic tube and selected by analog dials.
