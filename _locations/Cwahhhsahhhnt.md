## Description
A Croissant shaped speakeasy night club wrapped around a cavern with a petrified waterfall half submerged in naturally carbonated water. The club can only be reached through the back room of a [Depthsian](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Depths.html) bakery. The upper level is full of tiles tables while lower levels contain a restaurant, bar, and dance club.

They serve artisanal sparkling water tapped from the spring. And have hotpot style make your own flavor essences/gins setup on the tables for people to flavor their sparkling waters.

## Box text for players
You arrive at a small bakery with a purple glowing sign out front in the shape of a Croissant. Inside are tall cases stacked with pastries of all shapes and sizes. Behind the counter sits a glowering elderly being so shriveled as to be of indeterminate gender in a hairnet. "What can I get for you dear?"

After ordering, work the password "A watched dough never rises" into conversation.

They direct you to a case at the back of a store that swings open when they press a button under the counter. You enter a narrow corridor dimly illuminated in deep purple light. Ahead of you hear music and a sort of deep rumbling fizzing, like an open can of la croix the size of a house.

As you reach the end of the corridor you find your self looking out over a wide but low ceilinged room dimly lit by violet gas tubes and full of tables where couples and small groups dine. At the other end of the room the wall is an arc of clear crystal looking out into a large cave. Below chest level this cave appears filled with clear water full of slowly rising bubbles. Above this height it seems to be open air. From somewhere above a huge waterfall plunges into and through the surface of the water down into the distance below. But something strikes you as odd, you don't hear the sound of a waterfall. As you look again, you see that the waterfall entirely petrified with deposited minerals some time in the distant past.

To your left a spiral staircase passes through the room, the sounds of loud talking and music rises from below, while from above your hear cheering and the clacking of tiles.
