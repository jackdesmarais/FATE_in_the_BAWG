# Front Cross
The main [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html) public transit hub, where the local [The Conductors](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/factions/The_Conductors.html) mainframe is.

A huge circular tower with tram lines coming in from all directions and ringed with [Parachute Platform](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/items/Parachute_platform.html) docks. The central room has huge vaulted ceilings covered in murals and in the center is a giant statue, [The Statue of Aeolenon](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Statue_of_Aeolenon.html).
