# Description
The surface level of [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html) is the end of the line for the [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html) public [Parachute Platform](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/items/Parachute_platform.html) system. Down here [[Glitter]] dunes break against the base of the buttes holding up [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html). Sparsely populated due to the constant abrasion of windblownn Glitter, many Aeolians travel to the drifts to work harvesting the glitter that fuels the city's economy.
