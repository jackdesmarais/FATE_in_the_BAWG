# The Statue of Aeolenon
A large statue made of opaque [Sintered Crystal](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/items/Sintered_Crystal.html) in the middle of the main atrium at [Front Cross](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Front_Cross.html) station depicting [Aeolenon](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Aeolenon.html) parting the winds. The eyes are made of large (grapefruit sized) emeralds. The right one is currently missing crudely hacked from the face of the statue.
