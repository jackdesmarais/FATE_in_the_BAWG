# Description
[Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html)'s downstairs neighbor, a city built in tunnels and caves below the glitter sea. They have a bit of a punk, metal, outcast vibe. They trade water for vegetables with [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html) but they also produce Tubeworm and Scaly-foot locally.

## Box text for players
You descend the ladder in the maintenance tunnel for what seems like an eternity. Hundreds then thousands of rungs slip by, next to you water pipes and air ducts rattle suspiciously. Every once in a while there is the clattering whoosh as a freight elevator hurdles by somewhere off in the darkness. The light from the hatch above dwindles to a pinpoint and with the light goes the constant harmonics of [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html)'s wind. For what seems like ages you descend in darkness illuminated only by what you carry with you. Slowly from below you begin to hear a rising clamor. With the noise comes a thick clinging humidity and a sulfurous scent. After another eternity of climbing over rungs growing steadily slicker with condensation you find yourself descending into what appears to be a utility closet hewn from the rock and packed with sweating pipes. From beyond a banded stone door a cacophony. As you ease the door open to glance out you see a darkness that teems with movement surging and pulsing just beyond your sight. Strange sigils and symbols glow and flicker in the black, the only sources of light.

As you blink and your eyes adjust you make out that you stand on the edge of a bustling marketplace, the sigils hang from store fronts - gasjets in colored crystal tubes worked into business names and logos. The movement is the flow of bustling crowds. The light from the signs shines from black leather trench coats and piercings. Conversations and the calls of vendors layer over each other echoing and amplified by the tunnel walls and competing with the sounds of food sizzling over gas flames, the rumble of trains, and the rhythmic thump of distant music. The smell that hits you is melange of cooking spices, fish, and damp stone layered on top of a base of hot spring sulfur.
