# Resonance
Resonance is the concentrated connection to other dominant conceptual modes. It is wholly the substance of these other modes, pure darkness, hope, bog, or candy. It is a byproduct of channeling, and the base matter of avatars and spirits. Exposure to high quantities of magic, such as the body of an avatar or overdrawing when channeling causes resonance to build up in people and locations. This can cause changes that bring them more into line with the appropriate mode and eventually convert locations into breaches and people into avatars. In lower doses, these connections forged by exposure to resonance produce adaptations and open channeling connections. These are generally represented as attacks on the corruption track with consequences representing new mutations that may or may not come with adaptations/or channeling abilities. Taken out results indicate exploding into an avatar. Very low doses may cause only temporary aspects or boosts.

Someone with the appropriate skill (grounding) can distill resonance from magical items and areas into pure resonance that can then be stored and transported. However, resonance requires consciousness to become self sustaining, so in order to make more resonance, permanent items, or long term effects a human or spirit must be involved directly in the channeling the resonance.
