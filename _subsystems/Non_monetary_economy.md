# Non-monetary Economy
The economy largely works on a "gift economy", those in good standing in the community can just ask for what they want and the others in the community provide it. This of course comes with an expectation that all will provide what they can produce or do to the community free of charge. People build an informal social standing by providing services to others in the community and can loose that standing if they are seen to be asking frivolously or not giving back to the community. More formalized systems of ritualized gift giving take the place of long distance trade.

# Implementation:
The resources skill is replaced with a reputation skill that represents your standing with the society and ability to motivate people to give you things or do actions for you.
Succeed at a cost options for these rolls frequently involve taking conditions representing being thought of as a free-loader.
