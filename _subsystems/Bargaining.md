# Bargaining
## Permissions
Have an aspect that describes what you sold and what you got for it.
## Cost

An aspect slot
## Description
You have traded part of yourself and what makes you human to an avatar for a portion of what makes it an avatar.

Make an aspect defining what you gave up and what part of the avatar's purview you gained in return. You must give up part of what makes you human, this could be an important memory, the ability to feel sadness, the ability to derive enjoyment from music, etc. You gain an [Adaptation](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/subsystems/Adaptations.html), approach, or [Attunement](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/subsystems/Attunement.html) level. You can mark points of indebted to borrow additional abilities from your patron. Points of indebted may be cleared by furthering your avatar's agenda, indebted consequences may represent your avatar becoming directly involved, beginning to try to possess you, etc. The indebted track builds off of the control skill.

Short term bargains may also be made with avatars or minor spirits, in that case, take the bargain as a consequence, the consequence cannot be cleared while you have any debt. While the consequence is recovering you still haven't fully recovered what is missing but your power has largely faded.

If the avatar you connect to hasn't been described yet, make it.

## Direct [Resonance](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/subsystems/Resonance.html) bargains
Resonance when pure enough can also directly form bargains with people despite not being directly sentient. When this occurs the resonance gains an aspect representing what part of the person's humanity it took on. Once this has happened 3 times the resonance becomes a sprite and takes on a new high concept and trouble (keeping the 3 borrowed aspects). However, it risks reverting if those bargains are broken, so unless it can get solicit more bargains it needs to hope that it's bargainers pass before breaking their bargains and it can keep the new aspects.
