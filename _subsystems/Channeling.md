# Channeling
This is the major magic system for the campaign. It is a free-form system based on the idea of channeling energy from a conceptual realm into the world.

## Permissions
Have an aspect that reflects your connection to a spiritual realm

## Cost
Reduce your refresh by 1 (Waived for this campaign because it is part of the campaign conceit and everyone taking channeling means we don't need to worry about using refreash to maintain balance)
A skill slot

## Description
You can summon parts of your realm into the world. This is generally a less than subtle art. Take a skill called channel \[realm]. You may use this skill for actions representing directly summoning your realm. You may also make rolls with other skills with narrative permission to use the stuff of your realm as part of the action. If you are performing an action where this ability directly aids you, you may take corruption to operate at +1 [Scale](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/subsystems/Scale.html).

Channeling may also be used to produce temporary [Adaptations](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/subsystems/Adaptations.html) by directly dumping resonance into a target. This is an attack if they are unwilling or succeeds automatically if they are willing. This produces a consequence that represents a mutation. If you succeed on a channeling roll, you may define the adaptation that is produced, otherwise a different adaptation arises. The [Adaptation](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/subsystems/Adaptations.html) lasts as long as the consequence lasts, during the recovery the [Adaptation](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/subsystems/Adaptations.html) is gone but the side effects remain. This same strategy may be used to grant channeling ability to a new person. In either case, the it can be made permanent at the expense of a point of refresh and a permanent aspect change.

If the [spiritual realm](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/subsystems/Spiritual_realms.html) you connect to hasn't been described yet make it.
