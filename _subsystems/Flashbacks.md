Introduced in [Session_5](FATE_in_the_BAWG/session_notes/Arc_1/Scenario_1/2025_06_29_Session5_The_Delve_Begins.html).

**We Prepared For This**: during the heist/delve you have "prepared for", you may spend a Fate point to declare that you've prepared for this eventuality. This has greater scope than a normal declaration, and may theoretically allow you to solve problems 'before they happen'. You must make a roll on a relevant skill and play out a short scene narrating how you prepared. If you succeed, all is well and you may proceed as normal. If you fail or succeed at a cost, the cost of that is played out in the 'present'.
