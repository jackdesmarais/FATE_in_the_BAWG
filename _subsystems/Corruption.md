# Corruption
Corruption measures how much excess spiritual resonance a character has absorbed by using their magic at [Scale](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/subsystems/Scale.html) or by exposure to large concentrations of magical energy. Excess corruption can lead to various mutations, curses, reality breaches, or other strange afflictions and large enough amounts can cause a character to fully breach into a [Spiritual realm](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/subsystems/Spiritual_realms.html) forming a permanent bridge and becoming an avatar of that realm. In some cases however exposure to corruption can lead to the development of [Adaptations](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/subsystems/Adaptations.html) or [Channeling](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/subsystems/Channeling.html).

## Implementation
Characters take an additional stress track based on their grounding skill. Sources of corruption cause stress on this track (which in some cases can be defended against). Consequences due to corruption stress reflect mutations, curses, reality breaches, or other strange afflictions. Being taken out by corruption stress usually results in turning into an avatar while conceding frequently results in taking an additional adaptation or channeling (and reducing refresh by 1)
