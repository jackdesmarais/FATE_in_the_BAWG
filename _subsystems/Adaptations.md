# Adaptations
Adaptations represent the intrisic abilities and physical manifestations that some people derive from [Spiritual realms](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/concepts/Spiritual_realms.html). They tend to appear in people who have had a lot of exposure to that realm.

## Permissions

## Cost

## Description
You can do something qualitatively impossible maybe you can echolocate, have wings, see infer-red, or smell hope.

Describe a thing you can just do. The others at the table propose limitations, choose 1 or 2 in consultation with the table. Write this up the result as a stunt. When you want to do this you just can, no roll. If you are trying to do something more complicated that still requires a roll and where this ability directly aids you, you may take corruption to operate at +1 [Scale](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/subsytems/Scale.html).

If the [Spiritual realms](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/subsytems/Spiritual_realms.html) you connect to hasn't been described yet make it.
