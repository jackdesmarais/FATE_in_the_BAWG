# Summary
We used a *slight* modification of the "A Spark In FATE Core" setting creation workbook to build out the setting. 

## Media inspiration
| Player                   | Media                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| [[Jack Desmarais\|Jack]] | Malazan Book of the Fallen                  |
| [[Talia Rosen\|Talia]]   | Wicked / Wizard of Oz                       |
| [[Ava Hornblass\|Ava]]   | Balders Gate3 / Stormlight Archives         |
| [[Sarah Beatty\|Sarah]]  | Throne of Glass / Avatar the Last Airbender |
| [[Jana Desmarais\|Jana]] | Strange the Dreamer                         |

## Inspirations
1. We want magic (and dragons)
2. Both levity/whimsy and darkness
3. Tight-nit found family / teamwork
4. Altruistic goals
5. Stylistic powers not spells

## Genre/Scale
| Category | Description                             |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Genre    | Steampunk                               |
| Modifier | Technicolor                             |
| Summary  | Wizard of Oz meets Howl's Moving Castle |
| Scale    | Start small grow to world ending        |

## Facts
1. There is great public transit, but it only works in the sky and the surface not underground (Which is extensive)
2. People in [[The Depths]] are outcasts with their own community
3. World view is hopeful and people are generally good, but there is corruption
4. The economy is non-monetized
5. The population is focused in large urban centers separated by large areas of diverse wilderness
6. There is a central government ([The BAWG](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/factions/The_BAWG.html)) run by delegations from each city state 
7. Magic flows from connection to [The Spirit Realms](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Spirit_Realms.html)
	1. Each realm brings a certain type of power
8. Interaction with other realms increases your magical abilities but also changes you. 
	1. Going to far risks transforming you into an avatar of the realm
	2. Spirit realm avatars are partially ascended to [The Spirit Realms](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Spirit_Realms.html) but form a bridge increasing the local alignment with that realm
9. Any one can do magic but it's a skill you need to train. Most people know the type of magic their family/area use, but you can learn others
10. Humans may have adaptations based on the spirit realm associated with where they grew up
