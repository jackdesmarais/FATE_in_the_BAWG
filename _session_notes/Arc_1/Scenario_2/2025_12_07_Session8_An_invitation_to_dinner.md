# Recap/Notes
The girls received their letters! And they got spicy! [Lawrel Sundew](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/lawrel_sundew.html) is angry that her family is trying to get her tangled back up in politics (and maybe marry her off). [Leow Wind](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/leow_wind.html) is all flustered and bothered and doesn't want to go to the state dinner with the group! [Taffy Tawffee](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/taffy_tawffee.html) is happy with having received a new commission! They also noticed that [MAIL_MAN_7828gr483](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/MAIL_MAN_7828gr483.html) seemed to have a cold. Then [Grom theDilf](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Grom_theDilf.html) came by because the library has been shut down while a break in is being investigated. They set off to the library and notice the public transit is being delayed and that all of the conductors seem to be sick including [BUS_LADY_5432te79](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/BUS_LADY_5432te79.html). [Lawrel Sundew](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/lawrel_sundew.html) and [Taffy Tawffee](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/taffy_tawffee.html) talk to [BUS_LADY_5432te79](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/BUS_LADY_5432te79.html) learning that they seem to be infected with a water based resonance, and that their sickness doesn't seem contagious to people. They then investigate the library with [Lawrel Sundew](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/lawrel_sundew.html) and [Taffy Tawffee](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/taffy_tawffee.html) talking to the constables while [Leow Wind](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/leow_wind.html) goes to investigate the crime scene using this as a distraction. They discover that the cops are under a lot of pressure from the commissioner to crack down on crime in the city so that things look good for when the bog delegation arrives but they are also spread thin because people are being pulled away due to the conductor sickness and because they got a tip on the location of the prince. They also find out that the stolen book is [The Darudian Ritualis](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/items/The_Darudian_Ritualis.html) a book about magic from the glitter sea that includes a ritual to cause a sandstorm that might ground all the transit in the city. Further the thief pried their way in from an access tunnel to the depths using an edged weapon that [Leow Wind](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/leow_wind.html) was able to analyze metal fragments from and that the thief has resonance associated with hunters in the darkness that [Karst](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Karst.html) recognizes this is violent resonance that is uncommon in normal civilians.  The detective on the case tells [Lawrel Sundew](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/lawrel_sundew.html) to call him anytime for updates because she is a member of the bog delegation.
