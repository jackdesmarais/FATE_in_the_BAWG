# Session Notes
On the way back from the [Windy Gate Public Library](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Windy_Gate_Public_Library.html), the crew saw a commotion in [Front Cross](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Front_Cross.html) station. Police had setup a cordon around [The Statue of Aeolenon](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Statue_of_Aeolenon.html). When [Lawrel Sundew](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/lawrel_sundew.html) came to investigate she discovered that last night some vandals had struck removing the [Right Eye of Aeolenon](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/items/Right_Eye_of_Aeolenon.html) a large emerald that forms one of the eyes of the statue. [Leow Wind](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/leow_wind.html) was able to remember that this the [eye](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/items/Right_Eye_of_Aeolenon.html) was associated with [Aeolenon](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Aeolenon.html) the mystical founder of [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html), and is likely to be part of the resonance web [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html) uses to maintain their environment. He also shared with the group that the upcoming state dinner is part of the [Fall Festival of Ammothyella](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/culture/The_festivals_of_Ammothyella.html) where [The tear](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/items/The_tear.html) is brought from [The Statue of Aeolenon](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Statue_of_Aeolenon.html) to [The Statue of Pluton](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Statue_of_Pluton.html) to represent the renewal of trade ties between [The Depths](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Depths.html) and [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html) as each depends on the other ([Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html) gets their water from [The Depths](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Depths.html), while [The Depths](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Depths.html) gets their food from [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html)). And recalled the [Aeolian](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html) [legend of Aeolenon](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/culture/The_legend_of_Aeolenon.html), the Aeolian story of the founding of the city. Though he also recalled that [The Depths](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Depths.html) has their own version of the story where they come off as heros not villans. The group then split, with [Leow Wind](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/leow_wind.html) and [Taffy Tawffee](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/taffy_tawffee.html) going to [Taffys Tawfees](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Taffys_Tawfees.html) to engage in a candy making montage to prepare to cater [The festivals of Ammothyella](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/culture/The_festivals_of_Ammothyella.html). The candy sculpture went poorly, and [Leow Wind](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/leow_wind.html) had to detonate it, but the spread of tiny deserts went amazingly well and they now have a huge spread of tiny candy versions of foods. At the same time [Lawrel Sundew](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/lawrel_sundew.html) went to the [Aeol Police Station](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol_Police_Station.html), powering into the back office with sheer confidence and confronting [Police Commissioner Denise Demeric](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Police_Commissioner_Denise_Demeric.html). She had a full crash out during the meeting revealing how she is feeling about her family visiting and possibly marrying her off or sending her back to [The Bog City](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Bog_city.html). But she was able to get the [police commissioner](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Police_Commissioner_Denise_Demeric.html) to cut her in on the investigation, revealing that their main suspect is the [Roof Wardens](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/factions/Roof_Wardens.html) and that [Aeol City Government](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/factions/Aeol_City_Government.html) has invited the entire [bog witch delegation](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/factions/The_Bog_Witch_Delegation.html) to try to convince them to participate in a declaration of sister-city-hood that will hopefully come with the construction of an aquaduct from [The Bog City](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Bog_city.html) to [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html) making the city less dependent on [The Depths](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Depths.html) for water. She got permission from the [police commissioner](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Police_Commissioner_Denise_Demeric.html) to go undercover in [The Depths](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Depths.html) to try to uncover the plot. And received a pair of [Reverse Sole Pneumatic Radio Shoes](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/items/Reverse_Sole_Pneumatic_Radio_Shoes.html), an [invisible ink camera pen](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/items/invisible_ink_camera_pen.html), and three normal watches. She then returned to [Taffys Tawfees](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Taffys_Tawfees.html) where she filled in the group on what had occurred. [Lawrel Sundew](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/lawrel_sundew.html) and [Taffy Tawffee](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/taffy_tawffee.html) clashed over if it was better to take direct action or try to keep the group safe, and [Lawrel Sundew](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/lawrel_sundew.html) revealed that being married off and forced to live a diplomatic life, or returned to [The Bog City](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Bog_city.html) would be a disaster for her and she views this as a battle for life and death. [Leow Wind](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/leow_wind.html) said that maybe being with the prince wouldn't be too bad because maybe the prince wouldn't try to force her to live any differently than she already does. [Taffy Tawffee](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/taffy_tawffee.html) agreed to come along and join the undercover op. [Lawrel Sundew](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/lawrel_sundew.html) went into disguise by rinsing all the mud off. [Leow Wind](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/leow_wind.html) lost his composure, and could only look at the sky, the floor, or her boobs. They agreed to head into [The Depths](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Depths.html) through the hole in the back of the [Windy Gate Public Library](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Windy_Gate_Public_Library.html) and head to [Cwahhhsahhhnt](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Cwahhhsahhhnt.html) to try to find people willing to act against the roof wardens or evidence of the stolen [gem](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/items/Right_Eye_of_Aeolenon.html) or [book](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/items/The_Darudian_Ritualis.html).
