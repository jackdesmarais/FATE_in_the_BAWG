# Session Notes
We hammered out [Leow](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/leow_wind.html)'s new bargain ability. He can shape earth but it must be wet and he needs to take a consequence related to turning part of himself to stone to do it.
The girls descended into [The Depths](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Depths.html) visiting [West cleft Market](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/West_cleft_Market.html). They accommodated to the darkness by trying out new aspects of their magic. [Lawrel](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/lawrel_sundew.html) channeled [Bog](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/spiritual_realms/Bog.html) resonance into her eyes giving herself a resonance consequence "[Owwl](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/creatures/Owwl.html) eyes". Leow took an extra debt to [Karst](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/spiritual_realms/Karst_realm.html) to gain his cave sense for a while (knowing the shape of the cave and the location of everything touching the cave's walls or floor). [Taffy](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/taffy_tawffee.html) just decided to hold [Lawrel](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/lawrel_sundew.html)'s hand and be guided. They quickly outfit changed getting into leather trench coats to match the local aesthetic and got piercings as a group ([Leow](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/leow_wind.html): Black ring in his inner ear fold, [Lawrel](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/lawrel_sundew.html): Snake half ring in her eyebrow, [Taffy](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/taffy_tawffee.html): plain stud in one ear lobe). They also tried some local candy, small liquorish bites infused with mineral salts. They overheard some interesting tidbits about the political situation in [The Depths](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Depths.html) from listening to conversation in the market, It seems that people are split between wanting to act against [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html) now while they have leverage, pivot away from [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html) to try and develop alternative paths to food independence/surface outpost, and faith that the [Roof Wardens](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/factions/Roof_Wardens.html) will do something to disrupt the deal between [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html) and [The Bog City](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Bog_city.html). They then proceeded to [Cwahhhsahhhnt](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Cwahhhsahhhnt.html) where they get apple turnovers and a mushroom jam filled croissant before [Leow](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/leow_wind.html) gives the password to get into the club.
