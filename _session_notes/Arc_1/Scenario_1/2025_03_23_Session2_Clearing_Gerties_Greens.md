# Summary
The party helped [Gertie Green](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/characters/Gertie_Green.html) fix her farm's [dragon](/Fate_in_the_BAWG/creatures/Dragons.html) problem by constructing a large reinforced vine trellis equipped with jelly beans to attract the [dragons](/Fate_in_the_BAWG/creatures/Dragons.html) and explosives to constantly spook them. They then met [Jan Janson](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/characters/Jan_Janson.html) who recruited them to help resolve the larger [dragon](/Fate_in_the_BAWG/creatures/Dragons.html) problem of windy gate. When asked about events that had occurred ~2-3 weeks ago and might be the cause of the dragon swarm, he mentioned that about that time construction of [Pulley tower](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Pulley_tower.html) had gotten held up in zoning and safety panel meetings. The group went to a zoning panel meeting and managed to get some one-on-one time with [Wendy Garrison](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/characters/Wendy_Garrison.html) of the [Heavy Hoisters](/Fate_in_the_BAWG/factions/Heavy_Hoisters.html) and [Francie LaFerone](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/characters/Francie_LaFerone.html) of the [Pulley Pullers](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/factions/Pulley_Pullers.html). Learning that the [Heavy Hoisters](/Fate_in_the_BAWG/factions/Heavy_Hoisters.html) feeling threatened by the [Pulley Pullers](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/factions/Pulley_Pullers.html) moving in on their livelihood in [Windy Gate](/Fate_in_the_BAWG/locations/Windy_gate.html) had moved some survey flags to try and get construction workers to hit a sewer line causing delays in construction, but that someone had edited the city plans and the place that was supposed to be a sewer line was actually some sort of chamber containing an avatar associated with [the depths](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Depths.html). Dark, earthy, and wet resonance has spilled out corrupting the bottom third of [Pulley tower](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Pulley_tower.html). Construction has stoped while the [Pulley Pullers](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/factions/Pulley_Pullers.html) try to figure out how to decontaminate the site and sort out the legal challenges to their construction. In the meantime dragons are nesting in the exposed scaffolding and feeding on the leaking resonance.
