# Recap/Notes
The group split up to do prep for a delve into Pulley Tower! [Taffy Tawffee](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/taffy_tawfee.html) interviewed [Jane Jawnsdawttir](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Jane_Jawnsdawttir.html) and got the story of the breach into the hidden chamber. [Lawrel Sundew](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/lawrel_sundew.html) went to the  [Windy gate public library](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Windy_Gate_Public_Library.html) to learn about inside voices and research theories of how cities established their resonance in ancient days by burying avatars. In addition to personal assistance from [Grom the'Dilf](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Grom_theDilf.html) she also received a library card, a subscription to the library mailing list, and an invitation to the Saturday Community Sculpture group. [Awnna Breeze](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/awnna_breeze.html) and [Leow Wind](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/leow_wind.html) went to [Awnna's workshop](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Awnnas_workshop.html) and rigged up some [Hazmagic suits](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/items/Hazmagic_suits.html) to defend themselves from resonance of [Pulley tower](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Pulley_tower.html). The group then convened at [Taffy's Tawfees](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Taffys_tawfees.html). [Wendy Garrison](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/wendy_garrison.html) arrived for a secret conversation with [Leow Wind](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/leow_wind.html). There was a lot of attempts to investigate [Leow Wind](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/leow_wind.html)'s secretive and destructive behavior.
