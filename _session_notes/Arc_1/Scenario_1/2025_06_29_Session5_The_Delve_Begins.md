# Recap/Notes
The group finished their meeting with [Jeref Owne](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Jeref_Owne.html) and the [Roof Wardens](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/factions/Roof_Wardens.html). Receiving an [Avatar transport chest](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/items/Avatar_transport_chest.html) and the information that the aspect they face is an embodiment of Karst at the expense of ending up on the roof warden watchlist. The roof wardens then head off to setup an alternative location for containing [Karst](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Karst.html) while the group prepared to delve into [Pulley tower](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Pulley_tower.html). [Taffy Tawfee](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/taffy_tawfee.html) collected the names of candy store customers who would be interested in a spelunking vacation. [Lawrel Sundew](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/lawrel_sundew.html) provided a crate of clay that [Leow Wind](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/leow_wind.html) rigged with some sus explosives. [Lawrel Sundew](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/lawrel_sundew.html) went to the [Windy gate public library](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Windy_Gate_Public_Library.html) Saturday Community Sculpture group to practice first impressions with [Grom the'Dilf](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Grom_the_Dilf.html) and [Tim Welch](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Tim_Welch.html). They then headed to [Pulley tower](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Pulley_tower.html) which they decided to enter from [The Drifts](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Drifts.html). Upon entering the labyrinthine caves of the tower [Lawrel Sundew](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/lawrel_sundew.html) navigated past the river towards the center of the caves. As they went, they were attacked by a [Wyrm](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/creatures/Dragons.html) which won initiative and charged [Leow Wind](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/leow_wind.html) we'll see how it's attack resolves next time!
