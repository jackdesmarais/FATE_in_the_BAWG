# Recap/Notes
The group battled a [Gulper Wyrm](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/creatures/Wyrm_gulper.html) defeating it with a mixture of Bawg Maga, home-made frag grenades, and a giant wall of caramel. In the process they saw hints of 8ft tall slender figure changing the architecture of the cave to close off their retreat and direct river water through their fight. They then delved deeper into the caverns, [Taffy Tawffee](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/taffy_tawfee.html) and [Lawrel Sundew](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/lawrel_sundew.html) fending off a [Scrambler Wyrm](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/creatures/Wyrm_gulper.html) while [Leow Wind](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/leow_wind.html) tried to navigate but were redirected back to the river as the tunnels reformed around them. Over head they heard gunfire as the another delving team got mired down in the middle caverns. Below they heard crashing and the rushing of water as [Karst](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Karst.html) accomplished an unknown goal. The group then managed to avoid detection by the [Water Wyrms](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/creatures/Wyrm_water.html) in the river, and [Taffy Tawffee](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/taffy_tawfee.html), aided by [Leow Wind's](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/leow_wind.html) lore and [Lawrel Sundew's](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/lawrel_sundew.html) empathy, contacted [Karst](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Karst.html) by talking to the wall. The tall figure was briefly spotted as the tunnel they had traveled to the river redirected to the edge of a giant sinkhole leading deeper into the caves.
