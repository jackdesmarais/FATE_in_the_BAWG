# Recap/Notes
The crew met with [Karst](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Karst.html) to discuss solutions to their mutual problems. They learned that the cave system is [Karst's](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Karst.html)  body and that his major motivation is to not get put back in the box where he spent the last 500 years but that he's willing to work with them if they can help him avoid this fate. After more planning they decide the best strategy is to keep him in place so that he can form the foundation of [Pulley tower](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Pulley_tower.html) sealing off the top with a thick layer of clay so that his influence doesn't spread upwards and get lots of people in [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html) invested so the [Roof Wardens](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/factions/Roof_Wardens.html) can't just grab him and assassinate them. He wanted additional assurance that he would be able to maintain an outside connection, so [Leow Wind](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/leow_wind.html) agreed to a [Bargain](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/subsystems/bargains.html) with Karst to give him a connection to the outside even if he gets boxed up again. They then host a town hall meeting with [Jan Janson](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Jan_Janson.html) to pitch the solution to the town, [Taffy Tawffee](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/taffy_tawffee.html) invited the spelunking enthusiasts they had collected from her store. They got the [Pulley Pullers](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/factions/Pulley_Pullers.html) on board by telling them they can resume construction on the top of the building. They plan to get the [Heavy Hoisters](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/factions/Heavy_Hoisters.html) on board by contracting them to run a shuttle. The [Roof Wardens](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/factions/Roof_Wardens.html) are pretty furious with them because the have blown operational security, but don't currently see a way to take them down. and will be reaching out to install a power tap in the caves. Here ends [Scenario_1](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/session_notes/Scenario_1.html)!! Running a Major Milestone!
