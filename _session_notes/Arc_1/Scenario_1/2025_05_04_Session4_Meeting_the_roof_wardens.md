# Recap/Notes
The group spotted [Raoul](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Raoul.html) watching [Taffy's Tawfees](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Taffys_Tawfees.html). They set off in pursuit and caught him slightly up the street. As they brought him back to the shop, [Jeref Owne](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Jeref_Owne.html) approached and they discussed aiding the [Roof Wardens](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/factions/Roof_Wardens.html) with their efforts to re-contain and re-house the rogue avatar. They suggested that next steps needed were to identify a location to re-house it and do some investigation to determine precisely what it is an avatar of, and come up with a plan to reestablish containment. All while keeping everything hush-hush so that the Avatar's hiding place can be returned to secrecy.
