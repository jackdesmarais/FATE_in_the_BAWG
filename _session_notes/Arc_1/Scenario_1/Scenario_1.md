# Scenario 1

## Introduction
[Windy Gate](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Windy_Gate.html) is swarming with tiny dragons! They are getting into everything! Worse, they are sunning themselves on the windows of the vertical hydroponic farms, harming food production, and getting in the way of transit through the district, disrupting commuters! The local burrow council has asked you to look into the issue, figure out where the dragons are coming from and how to get them to move on!

## Game aspects
**Conflicting narratives of [the depths](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Depths.html)** \
**Something sus with public transport** \
**[Windy Gate](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Windy_Gate.html) has 99000 problems and tiny dragons are all of them** 

## Objectives
- [X] Figure out where the [dragons](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/creatures/Dragons.html) are coming from
- [X] Maybe some sort of follow up on [Pulley tower](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Pulley_tower.html)?
  - [X] Delve into pulley tower to find [Karst](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Karst.html)
  - [/] Convince (or force?) [Karst](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Karst.html) to submit to the [Avatar transport chest](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/items/Avatar_transport_chest.html)
- [X] Other stuff?
- [X] Figure out how to get the dragons to move on
- [X] Profit (non-monetary)!

# Conclusion
The group convinced [Karst](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Karst.html) to allow them to seal off the caves and integrate [Karst](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Karst.html) into the wider community by establishing a spelunking club. Construction on [Pulley tower](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Pulley_tower.html) can continue. As part of the deal [Leow](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/Leow_Wind.html) made a bargain with [Karst](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Karst.html) to give [Karst](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Karst.html) a foot hold in his mind.
