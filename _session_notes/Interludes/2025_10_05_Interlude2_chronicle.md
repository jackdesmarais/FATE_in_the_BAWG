We played a game of chronicle exploring how Karst became an avatar. In the process we discovered that Karst was originally a boy named Quar\$on Jeode who grew up in a city of gems. He liked rocks not gems though and fled to the caves to learn cave magic from Ma\$ter Quora. There he learned that it is possible to draw too much magic and become and avatar. Later when he returned home, he drew too much trying to impress his parents and childhood bully. in the process drawing too much and becoming an avatar.
