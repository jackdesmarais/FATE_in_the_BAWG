## Truths
1. Plants manipulate/control people into growing them in certain ways/places
2. The ability to grow plants was the foundation of civilization but was masterminded by the plants
	1. Each major civilizational emergence was engineered by a different set of plants.
		1. Colonialism is a side effect of invasive species. 
3. The world is just like the modern world, people aren't aware that plants are running the show
4. Plants produce a mind controlling substance that allows them to manipulate humans
	1. This only works on humans (not animals) because we are the dumbest animals
5. People give each other live plants and it's culturally important to care for these gifts
6. When people begin to figure out the plants are in charge, the plants administer a memory-erasing pollen. Pollen allergies are a side effect of this.

## Truths
1. The ability to grow plants was the foundation for human space exploration.
2. People still farm plants with normal agriculture
3. The world is a retro-futuristic world of biotech space exploration. 
	1. Think giant tree ships sailing with huge leaf solar sails to other planets.
	2. Cities built out of floating plants hanging in the upper atmosphere
4. Plants still need to root in soil (even if only a little bit) so people carry soil around in their pockets.
	1. A soil black market develops on new planets and sky cities (where there are shortages of soil for growing their plant technologies before enough compost develops to make soil abundant)
5. The eruption of Mt. Vesuvius didn't just destroy Pompeii, it also sent so much ash into the sky that it blocked out the sun. This lead to the rapid development of space technology to get above the ash layer and closer to the sun to allow plants to grow.
	1. People bred plants that were positively buoyant on air and are large enough to house people. This lead to the first air travel.
	2. Because plants grow toward the sun, where there were pockets of lighter ash, plants started floating upward on their own. This was the basis of plants becoming the vehicles for space travel.
