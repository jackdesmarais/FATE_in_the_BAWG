# FATE in the BAWG
This is a living world document for a homebrew FATE campaign set in the city of [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html). This game is a technicolor steampunk game with a free-form magic system built around channeling energy from conceptual elements. We are aiming for a lighthearted tone, but with occasional moments of darkness. 

# System
We are using the [FATE Core](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core) system. With some homebrew additions.
