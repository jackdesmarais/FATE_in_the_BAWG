# Francie LaFerone
Francie is short and thin with a swoop topped undercut, frameless glasses, and a loose button up with the collar open and the sleeves rolled up. Tattoos of intertwined mechanisms peak from the edges of their collars and cuffs. They run the [Windy Gate](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Windy_gate.html) chapter of the [Pulley Pullers](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/factions/pulley_pullers.html).
