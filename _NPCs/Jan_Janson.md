# Jan Janson
Jan Janson is a minor functionary for the [Windy Gate borough commission](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/factions/Windy_Gate_borough_commission.html), but he knows someday soon he'll be running all of [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html). Though currently stuck dealing with dragon population booms and legal battles over building permits, he sees each crisis as a potential big break that could launch his political career. He's always in a suit and tie with a sun shaped tie pin and a rock solid Mitt Romney haircut.
