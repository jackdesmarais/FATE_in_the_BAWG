# Chrystalis
The day after the shortest day of the year everyone in [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html) goes to watch the sunrise reflect off the crystal of the buildings. Families gather together to reflect on the year. This was the one time a year when [Leow Wind](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/PCs/leow_wind.html)'s family would gather together in a moment of peace.
