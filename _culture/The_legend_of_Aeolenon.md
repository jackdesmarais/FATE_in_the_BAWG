# The legend of Aeolenon
In the beginning, there was a small group of people living in the wind and sheltering from [Ammothyella](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Ammothyella.html). They were lead by two lovers [Aeolenon](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Aeolenon.html) and [Pluton](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Pluton.html). One day [Aeolenon](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Aeolenon.html) declared that they would no longer live in fear. They lead their people against [Ammothyella](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Ammothyella.html) and in a great effort drove it back. But they almost failed because [Pluton](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Pluton.html) proved cowardly and hid from the fight. [Aeolenon](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Aeolenon.html) saw them and instead of taking vengeance for their betrayal felt pity and wept for them. The tears sank into the earth and carved caves and [Pluton](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Pluton.html) retreated below to hide their shame. Because [Aeolenon](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Aeolenon.html) was so overcome and wept so much all of the water flowed down into the caves, and now [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html) is safe from the storms but must trade for water from [The Depths](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Depths.html).
