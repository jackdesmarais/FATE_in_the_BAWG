# The legend of Pluton
You have heard that the people of [The Depths](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Depths.html) have a different narative for the founding of their city that what appears in the [The legend of Aeolenon](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/culture/The_legend_of_Aeolenon.html). One assumes it is more flattering.
