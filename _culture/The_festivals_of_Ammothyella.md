# The festivals of Ammothyella
Every year on the equinoxes there are festivals where a procession caries a lemon sized sapphire shaped like a tear drop and called [The tear](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/items/The_tear.html) from [The Statue of Aeolenon](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Statue_of_Aeolenon.html) in [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html) to [The Statue of Pluton](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Statue_of_Pluton.html) in [The Depths](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Depths.html) (fall) or in reverse (spring) to symbolize the tears in [The legend of Aeolenon](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/culture/The_legend_of_Aeolenon.html) and [The legend of Pluton](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/culture/The_legend_of_Pluton.html) and re-ratify the trade deal that keeps both cities alive.
