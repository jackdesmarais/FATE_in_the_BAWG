# Karst
A realm of underground caves. Limestone rock hollowed out by seeping water. Important for [The Depths](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Depths.html), and currently venting into [Pulley tower](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Pulley_tower.html) through the avatar [Karst](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Karst.html).
