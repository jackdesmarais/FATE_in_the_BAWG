# Flora-Da
A realm of rampant plant growth, where plants have the ability to release mind control chemicals to control humans. Here plants secretly mastermind all of society. 

# Detailed description
1. Plants manipulate/control people into growing them in certain ways/places
2. The ability to grow plants was the foundation of civilization but was masterminded by the plants
	1. Each major civilizational emergence was engineered by a different set of plants.
		1. Colonialism is a side effect of invasive species. 
3. The world is just like the modern world, people aren't aware that plants are running the show
4. Plants produce a mind controlling substance that allows them to manipulate humans
	1. This only works on humans (not animals) because we are the dumbest animals
5. People give each other live plants and it's culturally important to care for these gifts
6. When people begin to figure out the plants are in charge, the plants administer a memory-erasing pollen. Pollen allergies are a side effect of this.
