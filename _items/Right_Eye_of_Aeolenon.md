# Right Eye of Aeolenon
A grapefruit sized emerald that used to serve as the right eye of [The Statue of Aeolenon](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Statue_of_Aeolenon.html). It is likely an artefact of some magical power involved in maintaining [Aeol's](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html) resonance.
