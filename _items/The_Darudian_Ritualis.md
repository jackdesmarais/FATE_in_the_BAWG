# The Darudian Ritualis
A travelog of a journey into the glitter sea containing rituals related to summoning sandstorms. Stolen from [The Windy Gate Public Library](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Windy_Gate_Public_Library.html) at the start of [Scenario 2](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/session_notes/Scenario_2.html).
