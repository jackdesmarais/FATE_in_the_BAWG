# Reverse Sole Pneumatic Radio Shoes
These shoes look like normal leather work shoes but they have a variety of enhancements that make them essential for the undercover operative.
1. The soles are on backwards (heel in front toe in back) to foil tracking.
2. They have a [Pneumatic Radio](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/items/Pneumatic_Radio.html) in the sole to allow stealthy communication back to base. Just make sure you extend the antenna and pump up the air reservoir.
3. Hidden 2 inch lifts.
