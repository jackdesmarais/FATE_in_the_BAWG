# The tear
A sapphire the size of a lemon. It is carried back and forth between [The Statue of Pluton](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Statue_of_Pluton.html) and [The Statue of Aeolenon](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Statue_of_Aeolenon.html) as part of [The festivals of Ammothyella](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/culture/The_festivals_of_Ammothyella.html) held every 6 months.

The people of [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.html) believe that it is the last tear wept by [Aeolenon](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/NPCs/Aeolenon.html) in [The legend of Aeolenon](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/culture/The_legend_of_Aeolenon.html) that crystalized after the rest of the tears had created [The Depths](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/The_Depths.html).
