# The Spires
Twining almost organic looking towers of Sintered Crystal rise from the dune fields around [Aeol](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/locations/Aeol.md). The spires are the iconic images everyone thinks of when they hear the city mentioned. The majority of the city's inhabitants live and work in these towers, and the spires are a constant swirl of activity. In the absence of roads linking the towers a profusion of ropes and cables network the towers together carrying gondolas and suspending bridges. The areas between these cables flock with residents gliding with squirrel-suites and kite-gliders, and swirl with [Dragons](/FATE_in_the_BAWG/creatures/Dragons.md) and kites. Markets find there places in open tunnels that pierce the sides of the towers. The constant wind over the cables and tunnel mouths raises a continuous background noise of aeolian harps, flutes, and singing bowls.
