# Scale
Scale is a measure of the level of spiritual power or physical size that an action or character possesses.

## Implementation
Apply +2 to the roll per level of scale difference between the participants or affect everything in and area (1 zone at +1 scale, 10 zones at +2 scale, etc). 

Charecters that operate at a base scale of +2 or higher generally use approaches instead of skills and are treated as a map instead of only a charecter. with 1 zone per approach and a default difficult of affecting that zone equal to the assigned approach.

Charecters that that operate at a base scale of +4 or higher are treated as an entire reagion instead of a map. They generally use rated aspects instead of approaches. With 1 map per aspect and a set of approaches for that map cascading down from that rating.
